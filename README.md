# cTools - Add Credentials To RDP File

## Description

Modify a .rdp file to add your credentials (password will be hashed). You provide a .rdp file and enter your credentials.
If you have already run the program on a .rdp file before, or the .rdp file already has credentials, the program will replace the existing credentials when you run the program.
